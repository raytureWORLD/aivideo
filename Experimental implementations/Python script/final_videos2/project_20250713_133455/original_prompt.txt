Saturn’s Rings: The idea that an asteroid impacted Saturn and its debris formed the rings around the planet, even further extrapolating that perhaps another, similar asteroid could impact us.

If other planets underwent monumentally cataclysmic events that fundamentally altered their nature in a way we don’t fully understand, perhaps life once existed on these planets and was obliterated, or moved to Earth.
